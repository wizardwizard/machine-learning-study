# machine-learning-study

## Module 0: prerequisite 
* Install IDE
* Setup python environment
* Use Anaconda/Miniconda
* etc. 

## Module 1: python programming
* Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis
* Must learn: week 1 to week 3
    * One study per week
    * This is the fundamental of python and very easy to learn. 
    
* Optional: week 4.
    * Statistical is useful in data science but it requires more math background. 
    * For the continuity of the study, you can skip week 4 first.
    * But if you want to get the certificate, we can learn week 4 together.


## Module 2: basis of machine learning
